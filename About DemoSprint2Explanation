The folder DemoSPrint 2 is almost done, still problems with Edge though.....

Negativ login in Edge has to have a space at the end of 
"assertTrue(MatchiSearchLogIn.logInNegativeCheck("Incorrect username or password_"));" to work, but FF and Chrome can't have that space.

Same with the method "MatchiSearchVenue.selectInOutCourt("Indoors_");"
